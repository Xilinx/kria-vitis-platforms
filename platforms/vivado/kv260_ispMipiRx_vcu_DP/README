The kv260_ispMipiRx_vcu_DP Vivado project is generated in this directory.
The kv260_ispMipiRx_vcu_DP design supports the following multimedia peripherals
and interfaces:

1. MIPI CSI PL interface connected to the AR1335 IAS image sensor and  on-board
   AP1302 ISP.

2. DisplayPort and HDMI Tx via the PS DP interface and on-board DP splitter.

3. USB 3.0 PS interface for connecting a UVC compliant USB webcam.

4. Hardened Video Codec Unit (VCU) consisting of H264/H265 encoder and decoder.

5. I2S audio Rx and Tx PL interfaces via optional PMOD.

6. Ethernet PS interface for video streaming protocols like RTSP.

7. SD card PS interface for video file playback and storage.

The Vivado block design (scripts/config_bd.tcl) defines the above
interfaces and peripherals. It also defines the Platform Interfaces
that acclerators can connect to.

Platform Interfaces supported:
******************************
* Clocks: clock_100M, clock_300M, and clock_600M  to drive clock inputs
          on the accelerator.
* Master AXI: M01_AXI to M15 _AXI AXI Memory Mapped master ports on
              axi_ic_accel_ctrl Interconnect to drive the accelerator's
              control port.
* Slave AXI:  S_AXI_HPC1_FPD, S_AXI_HP1_FPD and  S_AXI_LPD AXI Memory Mapped
              slave ports driven by the accelerator's read/write data ports.
* Interrupts: pl_ps_irq0[7:0] for the accelerator to drive interrupt signals.

For more information on how to setup Platform Interfaces refer to Xilinx Vitis Unified
Software Platform Documentation(UG1393)


Set Board Preset:
*****************

To build platforms make sure to set the Vivado Board Preset using the
following steps

1. git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore
2. Add the following line to Vivado initialization script
	set_param board.repoPaths {<path to the git repo>/boards/Xilinx}

The initialization tcl script for Vivado can be found at:

Linux: $HOME/.Xilinx/Vivado/Vivado_init.tcl
Windows: %APPDATA%/Roaming/Xilinx/Vivado/Vivado_init.tcl

Generate Extensible XSA :
*************************
An extensible XSA is required build a Vitis Platform which is in turn used to
integrate accelerators into the platform.

To build the XSA, run the following make command

> make xsa

The Makefile uses scripts/main.tcl file to create a vivado project, populate the
block design and finally build a XSA.

The generated XSA will be located at:

> ./project/kv260_ispMipiRx_vcu_DP.xsa


Modify the Vivado design:
*************************

To open the Vivado project run the following command from the
Vivado tcl console:

> open_project ./project/kv260_ispMipiRx_vcu_DP.xpr

The user can now modify the block design and run Vivado implementation
and bitstream generation in the Vivado cockpit.

To write out a new extensible platform XSA file, run the following
command from the Vivado tcl console:

> write_hw_platform -force -include_bit -file kv260_ispMipiRx_vcu_DP.xsa

The new XSA file can now be used replacing the existing XSA file in the Vitis
platform generation or as hardware handoff file inside the Petalinux project.
